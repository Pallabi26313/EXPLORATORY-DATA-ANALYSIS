# EXPLORATORY-DATA-ANALYSIS
This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset, using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. The code explores various aspects of the dataset, including univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis.
Here’s a detailed template for the **README.md** file for your GitHub repository:
## Project Overview

This project aims to explore the characteristics, relationships, and patterns within the Titanic dataset through the following types of analysis:
- **Univariate Analysis**: Distribution of individual variables (e.g., age, fare).
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Relationship between two variables (e.g., age vs. fare).
- **Multivariate Analysis**: Correlations between multiple variables.
- **Categorical Data Analysis**: Analysis of categorical features such as passenger class and survival.

## Dataset

The Titanic dataset is loaded using Seaborn’s built-in library. This dataset includes information on the passengers aboard the Titanic, such as:
- **Age**: The age of the passengers
- **Fare**: The ticket price each passenger paid
- **Pclass**: The passenger class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd)
- **Survived**: Whether the passenger survived or not (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- **Sex**: Gender of the passenger
- **Embarked**: The port where the passenger boarded the Titanic

## Code and Visualizations

### Steps Performed:
1. **Univariate Analysis**:
   - **Histogram**: Visualizes the age distribution of passengers.
   - **Box Plot**: Identifies outliers in the age data.
   
2. **Bivariate Analysis**:
   - **Scatter Plot**: Plots the relationship between `age` and `fare`.
   - **Correlation Heatmap**: Shows correlations between numeric variables, highlighting possible relationships.

3. **Categorical Data Analysis**:
   - **Count Plot**: Shows the distribution of passengers across different classes (1st, 2nd, and 3rd).
   - **Bar Plot**: Displays the survival rates for passengers in different classes.

### Technologies Used:
- **Python**
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations
- **Seaborn**: For creating beautiful statistical plots
- **Matplotlib**: For general plotting
